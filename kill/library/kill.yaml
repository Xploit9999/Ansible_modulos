module: kill
short_description: Kill a process by PID or name using a specified signal
description:
  - This module allows you to kill a process by either its PID or its name using a specified signal.
  - If the process is given by its PID, the module will attempt to kill the process directly.
  - If the process is specified by name, it will search for processes with that name and kill them using the specified signal.
  - The user must have root privileges to use this module, as killing processes requires elevated permissions.
