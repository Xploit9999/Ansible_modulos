module: get_pids
short_description: Retrieve the PIDs of processes by user or by process name.
description:
  - This module allows retrieving process IDs (PIDs) based on the user who owns the process or by the process name.
  - It supports case-insensitive searches and can output the PIDs in JSON format.
options:
  by_user:
    description:
      - The username for which you want to retrieve the processes.
      - If provided, this option retrieves the processes owned by the given user.
    required: false
    type: str
  by_name:
    description:
      - The name of the process to search for.
      - If provided, this option retrieves the PIDs of the processes matching the given name.
    required: false
    type: str
  ignore_case:
    description:
      - Set this to C(true) to perform a case-insensitive search for process names or usernames.
    required: false
    type: bool
    default: false

notes:
  - Either I(by_user) or I(by_name) must be provided. If neither is provided, the module will fail.
  - The I(ignore_case) option defaults to C(false), meaning the search is case-sensitive unless specified otherwise.
  - This module does not change the state of the system but retrieves process information.
examples:
  - name: Retrieve PIDs by username
    get_pids:
      by_user: "john"
  
  - name: Retrieve PIDs by process name
    get_pids:
      by_name: "bash"

  - name: Case-insensitive search by process name
    get_pids:
      by_name: "BASH"
      ignore_case: true

  - name: Retrieve PIDs by username, case-insensitive
    get_pids:
      by_user: "JOHN"
      ignore_case: true
